# ImGui Cheat Menu

A simple cheat menu made pretty quickly. Nothing really cool added to it aside from
the little tool tip & toggle button. Should compile straight with no errors. If you have errors make sure you have everything in the steps provided below.

## Installation

- Ensure DirectX SDK is installed 
- Use visual studio 2022 
- Compile on Debug on x64
